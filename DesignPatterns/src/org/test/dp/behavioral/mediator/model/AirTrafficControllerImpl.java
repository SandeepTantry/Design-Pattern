/**
 * Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
 * Promotes <b>many-to-many relationships</b> between interacting peers to "full object status".
 * Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly,
 * and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
 * Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact
 * Mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide way of communication.
 * 
 * eg. java.util.Timer - scheduleXXX() methods, java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(), Air Traffic Controller
