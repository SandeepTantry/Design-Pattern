/**
 * Visitor pattern is used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of Objects.
 * With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic from the objects to another class.
 * Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes on which it operates
 *
 * The benefit is, if the logic of operation changes, then we need to make change only in the visitor implementation rather than doing it in all the item classes.
 * Another, adding a new item to the system is easy, it will require change only in visitor interface and implementation and existing item classes will not be affected.
 * 
 * Eg. Shopping cart. When we click on checkout button, it calculates the total amount to be paid.
 * Now we can have the calculation logic in item classes or we can move out this logic to another class using visitor pattern.
 * Letâ€™s implement this in our example of visitor pattern.
